This is the final project for Udacity Robotics Software Engineering Nanodegree Program.
The goal of the project is to simulate a home service robot in gazebo.
The robot relies on ROS navigation stack and several additional packages for navigation.

The official ROS packages used in the project are:
1) gmapping: Provides laser-based SLAM and allows one to create 2D occupancy grid map from laser and pose data collected by a robot.
2) turtlebot_gazebo: Provides a model of a turtlebot robot that can be deployed in gazebo
3) turtlebot_rviz_launchers: Provides rviz configuration files very well suited for SLAM 
4) turtlebot_teleop: Provides means to control a turtlebot via keyboard

In addition to official packages several new ones were created:
1) pick_objects: defines a node that publishes navigational goals for the robot
2) add_markers: creates a node that is responcible for displaying a marker at pick up and drop off zones 

All script files are located under /Project_home_services/scripts
